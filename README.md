Starting attempts at migrating over the probablistic context free grammar parts developed for [https://github.com/DNGros/R-U-A-Robot](https://github.com/DNGros/R-U-A-Robot) into a stand alone package. This does not exist beyond just copying over some of the key files. Need to actually piece them together. Until that happens the origional repo is probably a better source since is more functional and actually provides a real-world use case and example.
